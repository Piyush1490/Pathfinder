## HI, WELCOME TO PATHFINDER!

Pathfinder is a project that I created to explore and showcase the power of pathfinding algorithms in a fun and interactive way. Using my knowledge of algorithms and programming, this application allows you to visualize how different algorithms find paths between two nodes. The primary algorithm used is DIJKSTRA'S ALGORITHM, which calculates the shortest path between two points while taking into account obstacles or "walls" placed in the path.

### Tutorial

This application uses Dijkstra's Algorithm. Dijkstra's algorithm is an efficient way to find the shortest paths between nodes in a graph, such as road networks. It was developed by computer scientist Edsger W. Dijkstra in 1956 and remains widely used today.

### How to Use:

### Move Nodes:

The starting node (green) can be moved by clicking and dragging it to any empty space.

Similarly, the end node (red) can be moved to any desired empty space.

### Build Walls:

Walls are obstacles that block the pathfinding algorithm.

To create walls, click and hold your mouse on empty nodes in the grid.

### Visualize Pathfinding:

Once the nodes and walls are set, run the algorithm to visualize how it calculates the shortest path.

# Experiment:

Move the nodes or add/remove walls to see how the algorithm adapts to changes in real-time.
